# CppPool
The cpp pool is a suite of varied projects designed to help us understand the specifics of C++ versus C. 

Each module is designed to help us understand certain parts of the C++ language.

  * C00 -> specificities of C++ compared to C.
  * C01 -> memory allocation, reference, pointers to members and switch usage in CPP.
  * C02 -> ad-hoc polymorphism, overloads and orthodox canonical classes in CPP.
  * C03 -> Inheritance in CPP.
  * C04 -> Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces in CPP.
  * C05 -> Try/Catch functions and exceptions in CPP.
  * C06 -> CPP casts.
  * C07 -> CPP templates.
  * C08 -> Template containers, iterators and algorithms in CPP. 

For each exercise there is a makefile that compiles and returns the requested program.
